This report presents to you your results for the big five inventory personality test. This test is based upon the work of Dr. Oliver P. John at the Berkeley Personality Lab. As the name suggests, there are five sections to this personality test. Your score will be between 1 and 5 for each category, where a score of 1 indicates that you have very little of this trait and 5 indicates that you strongly exhibit this trait. The five categories are extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. For each section you will be given your score and your percentile within your class. The figure accompanying each section shows you the distribution of your fellow student's scores in both histogram and density plot. The red line indicates the score that you got in the section. Information about what features are associated with each personality trait can be found on the Berkeley Personality Lab website (https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~johnlab/bfi.htm) or in the publications by the Oliver John lab.
